## Repo for all my diabetes prediction model code


- Most of these files are for the Flask app that I made which can be found [here on heroku.](http://adult-diabetes-predictor.herokuapp.com/) It can be slow to load because of the free tier used to host it, so please be patient.

- The meat of this project is found in [Model code and Dataframe csv.](https://github.com/Phatdeluxe/adult_diabetes_prediction/tree/master/Model%20code%20and%20Dataframe%20csv) This contains the notebook with all the data cleaning, wrangling, modeling, and visualizations. 

- [notebooks](https://github.com/Phatdeluxe/adult_diabetes_prediction/tree/master/notebooks) contains models for the app. I slimed down the features used in the app to make it a bit more approachable and made a smaller model that was then pickled for use in the app.
